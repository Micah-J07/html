    <h2><ins>Key Terms</ins></h2><br>
<details>
    <summary><mark>Current</mark></summary>
    <p>The rate of flow of electric charge/flow of electrons in a circuit. It is measured in <ins>amps</ins> (A).</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Potential Difference</mark> <strong>(Voltage)</strong></summary>
  <p>The <strong>difference</strong> in the amount of <strong>energy</strong> that electrons have between two points in a circuit. It is measured in <ins>volts</ins> (V).</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Power</mark></summary>
  <p>The <ins>rate</ins> at which something converts energy from one type to another. Power is measured in <strong>watts</strong>.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Insulator</mark></summary>
  <p>A material that does not conduct or allow <strong>electrical current or thermal (heat) energy</strong> to pass through very well. For example, paper, plastic and rubber are all insulators.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Conductor</mark></summary>
  <p>A material that is capable of easily transferring <strong>thermal (heat) energy or electrical charges</strong>. For example, silver, copper and steel are all excellent conductors of heat and electricity and are all types of metals. An example of a non-metal conductor is <strong>graphite</strong>, a form of carbon.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Ammeter</mark></summary>
  <p>A device that measures <strong>current</strong> in <ins>amps</ins>. The symbol is an "A" in a circle with two lines coming from it horizontally.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Voltmeter</mark></summary>
  <p>A device that measures <strong>volts/potential difference</strong> between <ins>two points in a circuit</ins>. Voltmeters are always connected in <strong>parallel</strong>. The symbol is a "V" in a circle with two lines coming from it horizontally.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Charging by friction</mark></summary>
  <p>When two objects <ins>rub</ins> against each other, electrons are <strong>transferred</strong>. We say the objects are now <ins>charged</ins> with <strong>static electricity</strong>.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Parallel Circuit</mark></summary>
  <p>A circuit that consists of <ins>two or more routes for the current to take</ins>. The current <ins>splits</ins> when the circuit branches off. The <strong>potential difference</strong> across the bulb is the <strong>same</strong>.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><mark>Series Circuit</mark></summary>
  <p>In a series circuit, there is only <strong>one route for the current to take</strong>. The current stays the same everywhere in the circuit and the <ins>potential difference</ins> across each lamp <strong>adds up to</strong> the p.d across the <strong>battery</strong>.</p>
